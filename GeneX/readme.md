X Chromosome

_The X chromosome is one of the two sex chromosomes that are involved in sex determination. Humans and most other mammals have two sex chromosomes (X and Y) that in combination determine the sex of an individual. Females have two X chromosomes in their cells, while males have one X and one Y_.

Is a boy X or Y chromosome?

_We inherit a set of 23 chromosomes from our mothers and another set of 23 from our fathers. One of those pairs are the chromosomes that determine the biological sex of a child – girls have an XX pair and boys have an XY pair, with very rare exceptions in certain disorders_.

Can a human have one X chromosome?

_About half of individuals with Turner syndrome have monosomy X, which means each cell in the individual's body has only one copy of the X chromosome instead of the usual two sex chromosomes. Turner syndrome can also occur if one of the sex chromosomes is partially missing or rearranged rather than completely absent_.

What are the human X and Y chromosome?

_In mammals, the sex chromosomes are called X and Y. Females have paired X chromosomes, one from each parent, while males have an X and a Y chromosome_.
