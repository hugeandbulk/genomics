X Chromosome

_The X chromosome is one of the two sex chromosomes that are involved in sex determination. Humans and most other mammals have two sex chromosomes (X and Y) that in combination determine the sex of an individual. Females have two X chromosomes in their cells, while males have one X and one Y_.

_The X chromosome likely contains 900 to 1,400 genes that provide instructions for making proteins. These proteins perform a variety of different roles in the body_.

X chromosome: _Humans and many other mammals have one pair of sex chromosomes in each cell. Females have two X chromosomes, while males have one X and one Y chromosome. The chromosome X represents about 5% of a cell's total DNA and likely contains about 900 genes_.

How many genes are in X chromosome?

_The Y chromosome is important in determining a person's biological gender. But it has much less of a say in someone's genetic makeup, since the X chromosome likely has more than 1,000 genes whereas the Y chromosome has fewer than 80_.

_The sequence of the X chromosome has been assembled from the individual clone sequences and comprises 16 contigs. These extend into the telomeric (TTAGGG)n repeat arrays at the ends of the chromosome arms, and include both pseudoautosomal regions (PARs)_.

Is a boy X or Y chromosome?

_We inherit a set of 23 chromosomes from our mothers and another set of 23 from our fathers. One of those pairs are the chromosomes that determine the biological sex of a child – girls have an XX pair and boys have an XY pair, with very rare exceptions in certain disorders_.

Can a human have one X chromosome?

_About half of individuals with Turner syndrome have monosomy X, which means each cell in the individual's body has only one copy of the X chromosome instead of the usual two sex chromosomes. Turner syndrome can also occur if one of the sex chromosomes is partially missing or rearranged rather than completely absent_.

What are the human X and Y chromosome?

_In mammals, the sex chromosomes are called X and Y. Females have paired X chromosomes, one from each parent, while males have an X and a Y chromosome_.

Is XY a baby girl?

_XY system In humans, females are XX and males are XY_.

Is XXY male or female?

_Usually, a female baby has 2 X chromosomes (XX) and a male has 1 X and 1 Y (XY). But in Klinefelter syndrome, a boy is born with an extra copy of the X chromosome (XXY). The X chromosome is not a "female" chromosome and is present in everyone. The presence of a Y chromosome denotes male sex_.

Which came first male or female?

_Genetics Suggest `Modern Female` Came First_.

Can a man have no Y chromosome?

_Maleness and femaleness are NOT determined by having an X or a Y, since switching a couple of genes around can turn things upside down. In fact, there's a whole lot more to maleness and femaleness than X or Y chromosomes. About 1 in 20,000 men has no Y chromosome, instead having 2 Xs_.

What determines gender?

_These are known as the sex chromosomes. Every egg has an X sex chromosome; a sperm can have either an X or a Y sex chromosome. If the sperm that fertilizes an egg has an X chromosome, the baby is female; if it has a Y chromosome, the baby will be a boy_.

What are the six sexes of humans?

_There are at least six biological sexes that can result in fairly normal lifespans. Kennon then lists six karyotype variations in humans: XX, XY, X, XXY, XYY, and XXXY_.

Who has 69 chromosomes?

_Triploidy is a rare genetic condition that causes a developing fetus to have 69 total chromosomes in their cells instead of 46 total. Most pregnancies end in a miscarriage because of complications from the condition. Triploidy happens randomly and it isn't the result of the birthing parent's age_.

Does XXY mean intersex?

_People who are male have XY chromosomes. People who are females have XX chromosomes. People who are intersex may have a mix of chromosomes, such as XXY. Or they may have some cells that are XY and some cells that are XX. Or they may have just one X chromosome (XO)_.

How long is human DNA?

_Each cell in the human body contains DNA that is 6 feet long, has approximately 3 billion base pairs and contains 30,000 genes. If we simply calculate the length of the DNA on the basis of the distance between each nucleotide, i.e. 0.34 nm or 0.34 x 10-9 m_.

Is DNA found in the blood?

_DNA is contained in blood, semen, skin cells, tissue, organs, muscle, brain cells, bone, teeth, hair, saliva, mucus, perspiration, fingernails, urine, feces, etc. Where can DNA evidence be found at a crime scene? DNA evidence can be collected from virtually anywhere_.

What is telomere and its function?

_Telomeres, the specific DNA–protein structures found at both ends of each chromosome, protect genome from nucleolytic degradation, unnecessary recombination, repair, and interchromosomal fusion. Telomeres therefore play a vital role in preserving the information in our genome_.
